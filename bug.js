This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before the component has mounted.  This often happens when you attempt to access `this.state` or `this.props` inside the constructor or before the component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method has been called.  React Native's lifecycle methods ensure state and props are available at the right times.

**Example:**
```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { data: this.props.initialData }; // Error: this.props might be undefined
  }
  // ...rest of the component
}
```
In this case, `this.props` might not be fully populated during the constructor.  Trying to read `this.props.initialData` might return `undefined`.
